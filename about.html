            <h2>Sophie Houser</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 font-weight-light">
                I love new strange situations, whether I find them through the projects I make, technologies I explore
                or places I go. I think when I, and others, are pushed out of our comfort zones safely, we’re able to
                try new ways of being, express novel ideas and have an openness to learn from others in ways we don’t in
                our day to day lives. I’m especially interested in using playfulness and humor as tools to create these
                experiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I was 17, I co-created a simple video game that featured a girl throwing tampons at oncoming
                enemies with a preamble about the stigma around menstruation. The game went viral overnight, generating
                thought and conversation globally around the menstrual taboo. It was a lesson not just in the power of
                play and humor to get people thinking and talking about something uncomfortable, but also the huge
                impact a small project can have, especially when the medium is code.
                <br>
                <br>
                After getting my B.A. at Brown University, where I studied Computer Science and Visual Arts, I moved to
                Berlin where I’ve worked for the past year and a half as a software engineer at Delivery Hero. I’ve
                learned there how to build backend services at a massive scale, and I’m now looking to use these skills
                in a more creative way, as I’d like to get back to my roots in animation, painting, creative coding and
                more.
            </p>
