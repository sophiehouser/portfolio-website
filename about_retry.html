                                        I’m Sophie. I love new strange situations, whether I find them through the projects I make, new technologies I explore or places I go. I think when I, and others, are pushed out of our comfort zones, in a safe way, we’re able to try new ways of being, express novel ideas and have an openness to learn from others in ways we don’t in our day to day lives. I’m especially interested in the way playfulness and humor can be tools to create situations like these.

                                        When I was 17, I co-created a simple video game that featured a girl throwing tampons at oncoming enemies with a preamble about the stigma around menstruation. The game went viral overnight, generating thought and conversation around the menstrual taboo globally. It was a lesson not just in the power of play and humor to get people thinking and talking about something uncomfortable, but also the huge impact a small project can have, and the power of creative coding.

                                        I’ve worked for the past year and a half as a software engineer at Delivery Hero, where I’ve learned how to build backend services at a massive scale. I’m now looking for my next step, as I’d like to get back to my more creative roots in animation, painting, creative coding and more.
