# Sophie's Portfolio Website

"My digital self" as some might say.

See live version at www.sophiehouser.com

## Known Issues

- When I factor out each page's CCS into its own file, the page doesn't load with styling. This means there's a lot of repetitve CCS and a lot of it directly in each page's HTML :/

## Notes

- `/scripts/tank*` - I've parked multiple versions of one small project in this folder. They are only slightly different from each other and only one of those files is actually used for the live version. You can find it at www.sophiehouser.com/tank.html.
